# August 26 2014 Meeting

## Preliminary agenda:
* Report on the WebDALI GUI 
* Mobile events list to integrate
  * device --> server
    * motion start
    * average cruise speed
    * motion stop
  * server --> device
    * path change opportunity

* ASP DALI module
  * Suggested reading: 
    * ["Answer Set Programming: A Primer"](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/tkren/pub/2009/rw2009-asp.pdf)

* DALI/ [Redis](http://redis.io) integration
  * Use the [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) server to implement a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web service interface to Redis 

## Homework:
Invent an ASP problem in asynchronous event context
- From agents events to ASP problem
- Mapping a known ASP problem (coloring) to a MAS events set. For Example: The graph itself could be the event data that the MAS have to produce.

How to integrate this solver?
